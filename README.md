Task 1: To-Do List Application

Task 2: Basic Calculator

Task 3: Password Generator

Task 4: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

Task 5: Contact Book

Project Structure:

The root folder contains the main README and a Tasks folder. Inside Tasks, each project folder includes:

A README file

The Python script

Output screenshot

Technologies Used:

Python and modules such as datetime, random, and string. Each project follows simple, structured programming practices.
