OVERALL PROJECT README:

Project Title:

CodSoft Python Programming Internship – Final Projects


Overview:

This repository contains five Python projects developed during my CodSoft Internship. Each task is designed to build a strong foundation in Python by focusing on real-world problem-solving, logical structuring, and modular coding skills. These projects demonstrate practical implementation of user interaction, data handling, and program flow control. All tasks are placed within the Tasks folder, each containing script files, screenshots, and a detailed README.


Tasks Included:

Task 1: To-Do List Application

Task 2: Basic Calculator

Task 3: Password Generator

Task 4: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

Task 5: Contact Book


Project Structure:

The repository is organized to maintain clarity and easy navigation. The main folder includes the root README and a Tasks directory, where each project is kept in its own dedicated folder containing all required files and documentation.


Technologies Used:

The projects are developed using Python and make use of its standard modules, including datetime, random, and string. These tools enable efficient handling of dates, randomization, and string operations while keeping the code clean and readable.
