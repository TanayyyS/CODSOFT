TASK 3 – PASSWORD GENERATOR:
Project Title:

Secure Password Generator

Overview:

This program generates secure and random passwords based on user-specified length. The password includes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters, ensuring high security. The tool is useful for creating strong passwords that meet modern digital safety requirements.

Features:

Generates strong, randomized passwords

Enforces a minimum length requirement for safety

Utilizes a mix of characters for increased complexity

Produces results instantly

How to Run:

Run password_generator.py using Python. Enter the desired password length when prompted.

Technologies Used:

Python, along with modules such as random and string for secure character generation.

Project Structure:

Includes a README, the password_generator.py script, and an output file showing password generation.

Input/Output Example:

The user provides the desired password length, and the program outputs a strong, mixed-character password.

Future Improvements:

Adding a password-strength indicator

Allowing customization of character sets (letters only, symbols optional, etc.)

Developing a GUI version
