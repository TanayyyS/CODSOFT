TASK 1 – TO-DO LIST APPLICATION:
Project Title:

To-Do List Application

Overview:

This project is a task‑management application that helps users maintain a list of their daily responsibilities. It supports functionalities such as adding, updating, viewing, and deleting tasks. The program also prevents users from entering deadlines that have already passed, ensuring task planning remains accurate and useful.

Features:

Add tasks along with specific deadlines

Update existing task information

Delete unnecessary tasks

View all tasks in list format

Validate deadlines to prevent past-date entries

How to Run:

Open any terminal and run the file named to_do_list.py using Python. The program will guide users with menu options for each feature.

Technologies Used:

Python and the datetime module are used to handle user input, validate dates, and maintain a clear workflow.

Project Structure:

This folder contains a README, the to_do_list.py script, and an output file showing successful execution of the program.

Input/Output Example:

A user inputs a task name and a valid deadline. When the data is correct, the system confirms the task has been successfully added.

Future Improvements:

Development of a graphical user interface for easier operation

Support for long-term data storage using files or databases
